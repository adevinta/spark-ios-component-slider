## Usage
Both UIKit and SwiftUI sliders are generic and can be created with any type that conforms to: 
* V: [BinaryFloatingPoint](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/binaryfloatingpoint)
* V.Stride: BinaryFloatingPoint

Quick list of examples: `Float`, `CGFloat`, `Double`

### Properties
* `theme`: The slider's current theme
* `shape`: The slider's current shape (`square` or `rounded`)
* `intent`: The slider's current intent
* `value`: The sliderâ€™s current value
* `range` (UIKit) / `bounds` (SwiftUI): The bounds of the slider
* `step`: The distance between each valid value

### UIKit: SliderUIControl
```swift
let slider: SliderUIControl<Float> = SliderUIControl(
    theme: theme,
    shape: .rounded,
    intent: .basic
)
```

### SwiftUI: Slider
```swift
@State let value: Float
...
let slider = Slider(
    theme: theme,
    shape: .rounded,
    intent: .support,
    value: $value,
    in: 0...0.4, // Default value `0...1`
    onEditingChanged: { isEditing in // Default value `{ _ in }`
        // TODO
    })
)
```
or
```swift
@State let value: Float
...
let slider = Slider(
    theme: theme,
    shape: .square,
    intent: .main,
    value: $value,
    in: 0...10, // Default value `0...1`
    step: 2.5, // Default value `1`
    onEditingChanged: { isEditing in // Default value `{ _ in }`
        // TODO
    })
